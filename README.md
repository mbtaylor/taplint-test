# taplint-test

This is a small package for personal use that performs regression tests
on taplint.  It runs a given version of taplint against a number of
different TAP services and outputs the result.  These results are
archived so they can be diffed against results obtained later.
Such diffs can be used to assess both version-dependent changes
in taplint behaviour and changes in service implementation.
